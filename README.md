# Hello WorldðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my page!

I am a developer with experience in office work and customer service living in Auckland, New Zealand. Realizing the increasing automation of many systems and the constant evolution in this field, I chose to pursue a career in software development.

I have experienced the automation trends sweeping through industries and witnessed how technology is revolutionising traditional workplace functions. This realisation has motivated me to pursue a career in software development. I believe that by actively engaging in the field responsible for driving these changes, I can remain relevant and continuously evolve throughout my career.
